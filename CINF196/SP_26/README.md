**Course Description:**

Creative AI is a 100-level undergraduate course that introduces students
with no technical background to how artificial intelligence is
transforming creative practices in visual art, music, film,
storytelling, and entertainment media. Students will conceptually
explore creative AI models—including large language models, image and
video generators (such as diffusion models), and generative adversarial
networks (GANs)—while using contemporary tools to produce their own
text, image, audio, and multimedia works. Alongside hands-on creative
experimentation, the course critically examines ethical, legal, and
social issues such as privacy, copyright and ownership, bias and
representation, consent, and deepfakes in media and entertainment.

**Expected Student Learning Outcomes:**

The primary objectives of this course are to help students understand:

- How modern creative AI systems (e.g., large language models, diffusion
  models, GANs) function conceptually, including their strengths and
  limitations in artistic and entertainment contexts.

- How creative AI tools intersect with society, culture, and the
  creative industries, including ethical, legal, and social implications
  such as privacy, authorship, and representation.

The course prioritizes active, studio-style learning, which is
especially important in the rapidly evolving area of creative AI, where
specific tools change quickly. The focus is on learning how to navigate
and critically engage with creative AI systems and workflows, rather
than memorizing static technical details.

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Describe core concepts, capabilities, and limitations of creative AI
    models (e.g., large language models, diffusion models, GANs) in
    accessible, non-technical language. (C1.1 B)

    - Measure: Students will explain key ideas in short written
      responses, concept maps, or low-stakes quizzes.

    - Corresponding Assignment: In-Class Concept Activities & Weekly
      Quizzes.

2.  Use contemporary generative AI tools to create original artistic and
    entertainment-focused media aligned with an intentional creative
    goal. (C1.2 I)

    - Measure: Students will produce text, image, audio, or mixed-media
      artifacts that demonstrate purposeful use of tools, not random
      outputs.

    - Corresponding Assignment: Generative Text Assignment & Generative
      Image/Media Assignment.

3.  Apply creative AI tools to ideation and iterative development of
    stories, characters, visuals, and/or sound. (C1.3 I)

    - Measure: Students will show progression from initial drafts to
      refined versions, documenting iterations and decision-making.

    - Corresponding Assignment: Creative Practice Assignments & Creative
      AI Mini-Project or Case Study.

4.  Critically evaluate AI-generated media for originality, bias,
    representation, and aesthetic quality using criteria drawn from
    course readings and discussions. (1.3 I)

    - Measure: Students will write critiques or lead discussions that
      analyze AI-generated works using multiple perspectives (technical,
      social, and artistic).

    - Corresponding Assignment: Critical Review / Reflection on
      AI-Generated Media.

5.  Recognize and analyze ethical, legal, and social implications of
    creative AI, including privacy, consent, copyright, and deepfakes,
    and articulate informed positions. (4.2 I)

    - Measure: Students will analyze case studies and argue for
      responsible practices in written reflections or in-class debates.

    - Corresponding Assignment: Ethics & Policy Case Study Assignment.

6.  Communicate their creative AI process and outcomes effectively to
    both technical and non-technical audiences through written, visual,
    and oral formats. (3.2 I)

    - Measure: Students will present their projects clearly in a
      poster-style format and an accompanying short talk, demonstrating
      audience-aware communication.

    - Corresponding Assignment: Final Project Poster & Showcase
      Presentation.

7.  Collaborate effectively in small teams (or structured partnerships)
    to plan, develop, and refine a creative AI project. (5.1 B)

    - Measure: Students will co-create a project plan, divide
      responsibilities, and reflect on teamwork dynamics and
      contributions.

    - Corresponding Assignment: Final Creative AI Project (Team Plan +
      Peer/Team Reflection).

**Prerequisites:**

*None.*

**Required Readings:**

<img src="media/image1.png" style="width:1.56528in;height:1.93611in" />

**AI for Creative Production by Iain Anderson**

O’Reilly Media (2026)ISBN-13: 978-1806025800

In addition to the required textbook, students will have short
supplementary readings available online or via Brightspace. When these
readings are assigned, the instructor will indicate where they can be
accessed. These materials will span multiple fields—including computer
science, media studies, psychology, informatics, law, and the creative
arts—to provide diverse perspectives on creative AI in art, music, film,
and entertainment. Together, they will give students the background
needed to critically evaluate AI-generated media, understand issues such
as authorship, privacy, and copyright, and more confidently navigate
their own creative and digital lives in a rapidly evolving technological
landscape.

The above formula is the definitive grading scheme. Any “Total,”
“Weighted Total,” etc. given by Brightspace does not reflect the actual
grading scheme and should be ignored.

Grades are assigned based upon the percentage of points achieved by the
student in the course, as weighted per the above table. The overall
course **will not** be curved, although the professor retains the right
curve individual assignments if the grade distribution is extreme enough
to unfairly weight the overall course against the students.

This course is A-E graded and the grades are determined based on graded
assignments. Your final grade will be based on a scale of 100 points:

| **A**  | **A-** | **B+** | **B** | **B-** | **C+** | **C** | **C-** | **D+** | **D** | **D-** | **E** |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| 100-94 | 93-89  | 88-85  | 84-82 | 81-79  | 78-76  | 75-73 | 72-70  | 69-67  | 66-64 | 63-60  | 59-0  |

**CEHC Showcase**

**CEHC Showcase** is designed as an opportunity for students within the
information, informatics, game design and development, emergency
management, homeland security and cybersecurity fields to highlight and
present interesting projects, research, and concepts they are learning
within their courses. It also provides students with an opportunity to
showcase their findings to others and develop highly desired
presentation and people skills. The CEHC Showcase in the Fall 2025
semester will be held on **<u>Thursday, April 30th, 9:00-4:00 in
ETEC</u>**. All students in CINF 196 **will be presenting** at this
event and should reserve that time in their schedule. If your schedule
does not permit you to attend, you will have an alternative assignment.
**Students are expected to design and present a poster in the showcase;
other presentation formats, such as PPT or no poster, will not be
accepted. *Note:*** I grade easier for Showcase presentations than for
the alternative assignment so you should seriously consider your
schedule limitations!

**Policies:**

**Attendance Policy:** This is an in-person course, and therefore there
are specified class sessions where attendance will be taken. Course
progression will be measured by completion of the required assignments
and exams, and there are grade given for participation or attendance.

**Missed Exams and Assignments:** Students missing an examination or
exercise due to illness or personal/family emergencies will be excused
**provided** that you notify the professor via email on the day of the
absence or earlier that the absence meets university policies on excused
absences ([see the
link](https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html)),
and that **required documentation** is submitted to the professor at the
next class session. Any assignments missed due to a documented and
approved absence will need to be made up within one week of the absence,
and it is the student’s responsibility to coordinate with the professor
to make up the assignment within that time period.

**Absence due to religious observance:** New York State Education Law
(Section 224-a) - Campuses are required to excuse, without penalty,
individual students absent because of religious beliefs, and to provide
equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work
requirements missed because of such absences. You will be required to
notify the professor **at least three days prior** to the religious
observance that you will not be able to complete the assignment, and
then an alternative date or accommodation will be made.

**Disability Policy:** Reasonable accommodations will be provided for
students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, medical,
cognitive, learning and mental health (psychiatric) disabilities. If you
believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class,
please notify [Disability Access and Inclusion Student
Services](mailto:Disability%20Access%20and%20Inclusion%20Student%20Services)
(518- 442-5501; daiss@albany.edu). Upon verification and after the
registration process is complete, the DAISS will provide you with a
letter that informs the course instructor that you are a student with a
disability registered with the DAISS and list the recommended reasonable
accommodations. You can review the [Equity and Compliance
website](https://www.albany.edu/equity-compliance) as well for
additional information.

# Extra Credit: Extra credit can be earned in a number of ways. All require consultation with the instructor before they are commenced. All extra-credit opportunities are capped at no more than 3 points (3%) of your overall grade.

- *Community:* CEHC sponsors several events throughout the semester. Any
  student who attends one or more of those events may receive extra
  credit. Details about specific qualifying events will be made
  available in advance.

- Other extra credit opportunities may be available. Details to follow.

**Withdrawal from the Course:** The drop date for the Spring 2026
semester is Tuesday, February 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2026, for undergraduate
students. That is the last date you can drop a course and not receive a
'W'. It is your responsibility to take action by this date if you wish
to drop the course. In particular, grades of "incomplete" will not be
awarded to students because they missed the drop deadline.

**Incomplete Grade Policy (amended effective Fall 2020 and will apply to
all undergraduate Incompletes issued Fall 2020 and thereafter):**

I: Incomplete. A grade of I is a temporary grade assigned at the
discretion of the instructor when a student has been unable to complete
a class for reasons which are considered to be extenuating and beyond
the student's control. These reasons must be documented at the time of
the request. Incomplete grades do not count toward graduation.

Undergraduate students taking graduate level classes will be subject to
the Graduate Incomplete Policy for the graduate class.

Incomplete grades should ONLY be assigned:

1.  When a student makes a direct request to the instructor;

2.  The student's work to date is passing;

3.  An illness or other extenuating circumstance prevents completion of
    required work by the due date;

4.  Required work may reasonably be completed in an agreed-upon period
    (not to exceed the maximum allowable time for the completion of work
    as stated in the Timeline for Incomplete Grades), and does not
    require the student to retake any portion of the class.

If all of the above four criteria are not met, the student should be
graded according to the work completed for the class, even if this means
recording a failing grade.

Students and instructors should be mindful that making up work can be
extremely difficult given the workload of a new semester.

Incomplete grades should NOT be assigned:

- To students who do not make a direct request to the instructor

- As a substitute for a failing grade

- Where the student's performance to date clearly indicates an inability
  to complete the class as defined in the original syllabus

- If the student did not attend or stopped attending

- As a means of allowing a student to raise their grade by completing
  additional work not assigned to other students

- If re-enrollment is required for successful completion of the class

**Timeline for Incomplete Grades**

The maximum allowable time for the completion of work related to an
Incomplete is:

- Fall and Winter: convert to failing grades in April of the following
  Spring semester – dates and deadlines to be communicated by the
  Registrar’s office

- Spring and Summer: convert to failing grades in November of the
  following Fall semester – dates and deadlines to be communicated by
  the Registrar’s office

Dates and deadlines will be listed on the Academic Calendar and
communicated by the Registrar’s Office.

Instructors may require that work be completed in advance of the
deadline.

Questions about incomplete grades should be addressed to the instructor.
If an incomplete grade is agreed upon, the instructor is responsible for
entering the incomplete grade in the grade roster during final grading,
as well as changing the grade to a final grade by the incomplete grade
deadline. See Guidelines for Instructors for more information on
entering and changing grades. If an instructor is no longer available,
the chair of the department or dean of the school/college, in which the
class was offered, is authorized to supervise completion of the work and
to submit the appropriate grade change request.

Any grade of I existing after the stated deadline shall be automatically
changed to E or U according to whether or not the student is enrolled
for A–E or S/U grading. Except for extenuating circumstances approved by
the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, these
converted grades may not be later changed.

(NOTE: Students receiving financial assistance through state awards
should refer to Academic Criteria for State Awards in the expenses and
financial aid section of this bulletin before requesting grades of I.)

*Important:* Incompletes will not be given to students who have not
fulfilled their classwork obligations, and who, at the end of the
semester, are looking to avoid failing the course. This is asking for
special treatment.

## Academic Integrity: It is every student’s responsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at the University. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity. See <http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html>

Coursework and examinations are considered individual exercises. Copying
the work of others is a violation of university rules on academic
integrity.  Individual coursework is also key to your being prepared and
performing well on tests and exams. Forming study groups and discussing
assignments and techniques in general terms is encouraged, but the final
work must be your own work. **For example, two or more people may not
create an assignment together and submit it for credit. Credit will not
be given for identical final project reports with different color
palettes unless it is a group project identified by the instructor.** If
you have specific questions about this or any other policy, please ask.

The following is a list of the types of behaviors that are defined as
examples of academic dishonesty and are therefore unacceptable. Attempts
to commit such acts also fall under the term academic dishonesty and are
subject to penalty. No set of guidelines can, of course, define all
possible types or degrees of academic dishonesty; thus, the following
descriptions should be understood as examples of infractions rather than
an exhaustive list.

- Plagiarism

- Allowing other students to see or copy your assignments or exams

- Examining or copying another student’s assignments or exams

- Lying to the professor about issues of academic integrity

- Submitting the same work for multiple assignments/classes without
  prior consent from the instructor(s)

- Getting answers or help from people, or other sources (*e.g.* research
  papers, web sites) without acknowledging them.

- Forgery

- Sabotage

- Unauthorized Collaboration (just check first!)

- Falsification

## Time Management: For every credit hour that a course meets, students should expect to work 3 additional hours outside of class every week (3 x 3= 9). For a three-credit course, you should expect to work 9 hours outside of class every week. Manage your time effectively to complete readings, assignments, and projects.

**Instructor Availability**: The instructor will be available for
student consultation during office hours, by appointment, and online in
Brightspace. Students are expected to check Brightspace messages
(internal) at least once every day to see whether the instructor is
trying to reach them. Students should not assume that instructor is
online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to answer your questions
immediately (even though the instructor will try to do so as much as
possible).

**Courtesy** In class (online) discussions the instructor and students
are expected to demonstrate professional behavior. This means
cooperating and interacting in a courteous, supportive, and tactful
manner based on mutual respect for each other's ideas.

**Students and professor should be professional at all time. Faculty
should be addressed as Prof. XXX or Dr. XXX. Emails should be addressed
“Dear…” and end with a “Thank you.” *Disrespect in any form in any CEHC
class will not be tolerated.***

**Respect for Diversity:** It is my intent that students from all
diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that
students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that
the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource,
strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and
activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality,
disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture.
Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways
to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for
other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class
meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that
we can make arrangements for you.[^1]
