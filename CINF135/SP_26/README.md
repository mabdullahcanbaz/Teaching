The above formula is the definitive grading scheme. Any “Total,” “Weighted Total,” etc. given by Brightspace does not reflect the actual grading scheme and should be ignored.

Grades are assigned based upon the percentage of points achieved by the student in the course, as weighted per the above table. The overall course **will not** be curved, although the professor retains the right curve individual assignments if the grade distribution is extreme enough to unfairly weight the overall course against the students.

This course is A-E graded and the grades are determined based on graded assignments. Your final grade will be based on a scale of 100 points:

| **A**  | **A-** | **B+** | **B** | **B-** | **C+** | **C** | **C-** | **D+** | **D** | **D-** | **E** |

## Policies:

**Attendance Policy:** This is an in-person course, and therefore there
are specified class sessions where attendance will be taken. Course
progression will be measured by completion of the required assignments
and exams, and there are grade given for participation or attendance.

**Missed Exams and Assignments:** Students missing an examination or
exercise due to illness or personal/family emergencies will be excused
**provided** that you notify the professor via email on the day of the
absence or earlier that the absence meets university policies on excused
absences ([see the
link](https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html)),
and that **required documentation** is submitted to the professor at the
next class session. Any assignments missed due to a documented and
approved absence will need to be made up within one week of the absence,
and it is the student’s responsibility to coordinate with the professor
to make up the assignment within that time period.

**Absence due to religious observance:** New York State Education Law
(Section 224-a) - Campuses are required to excuse, without penalty,
individual students absent because of religious beliefs, and to provide
equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work
requirements missed because of such absences. You will be required to
notify the professor **at least three days prior** to the religious
observance that you will not be able to complete the assignment, and
then an alternative date or accommodation will be made.

**Disability Policy:** Reasonable accommodations will be provided for
students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, medical,
cognitive, learning and mental health (psychiatric) disabilities. If you
believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class,
please notify [Disability Access and Inclusion Student
Services](mailto:Disability%20Access%20and%20Inclusion%20Student%20Services)
(518- 442-5501; daiss@albany.edu). Upon verification and after the
registration process is complete, the DAISS will provide you with a
letter that informs the course instructor that you are a student with a
disability registered with the DAISS and list the recommended reasonable
accommodations. You can review the [Equity and Compliance
website](https://www.albany.edu/equity-compliance) as well for
additional information.

**Extra Credit: Extra credit can be earned in a number of ways. All require consultation with the instructor before they are commenced. All extra-credit opportunities are capped at no more than 3 points (3%) of your overall grade.**

- *Community:* CEHC sponsors several events throughout the semester. Any
  student who attends one or more of those events may receive extra
  credit. Details about specific qualifying events will be made
  available in advance.

- Other extra credit opportunities may be available. Details to follow.

**Withdrawal from the Course:** The drop date for the Spring 2025
semester is Tuesday, January 28th, 2025 for undergraduate students. That is
the last date you can drop a course and not receive a 'W'. It is your
responsibility to take action by this date if you wish to drop the
course. In particular, grades of "incomplete" will not be awarded to
students because they missed the drop deadline.

**Incomplete Grade Policy (amended effective Fall 2020 and will apply to
all undergraduate Incompletes issued Fall 2020 and thereafter):**

I: Incomplete. A grade of I is a temporary grade assigned at the
discretion of the instructor when a student has been unable to complete
a class for reasons which are considered to be extenuating and beyond
the student's control. These reasons must be documented at the time of
the request. Incomplete grades do not count toward graduation.

Undergraduate students taking graduate level classes will be subject to
the Graduate Incomplete Policy for the graduate class.

Incomplete grades should ONLY be assigned:

1.  When a student makes a direct request to the instructor;

2.  The student's work to date is passing;

3.  An illness or other extenuating circumstance prevents completion of
    required work by the due date;

4.  Required work may reasonably be completed in an agreed-upon period
    (not to exceed the maximum allowable time for the completion of work
    as stated in the Timeline for Incomplete Grades), and does not
    require the student to retake any portion of the class.

If all of the above four criteria are not met, the student should be
graded according to the work completed for the class, even if this means
recording a failing grade.

Students and instructors should be mindful that making up work can be
extremely difficult given the workload of a new semester.

Incomplete grades should NOT be assigned:

- To students who do not make a direct request to the instructor

- As a substitute for a failing grade

- Where the student's performance to date clearly indicates an inability
  to complete the class as defined in the original syllabus

- If the student did not attend or stopped attending

- As a means of allowing a student to raise their grade by completing
  additional work not assigned to other students

- If re-enrollment is required for successful completion of the class

**Timeline for Incomplete Grades**

The maximum allowable time for the completion of work related to an
Incomplete is:

- Fall and Winter: convert to failing grades in April of the following
  Spring semester – dates and deadlines to be communicated by the
  Registrar’s office

- Spring and Summer: convert to failing grades in November of the
  following Fall semester – dates and deadlines to be communicated by
  the Registrar’s office

Dates and deadlines will be listed on the Academic Calendar and
communicated by the Registrar’s Office.

Instructors may require that work be completed in advance of the
deadline.

Questions about incomplete grades should be addressed to the instructor.
If an incomplete grade is agreed upon, the instructor is responsible for
entering the incomplete grade in the grade roster during final grading,
as well as changing the grade to a final grade by the incomplete grade
deadline. See Guidelines for Instructors for more information on
entering and changing grades. If an instructor is no longer available,
the chair of the department or dean of the school/college, in which the
class was offered, is authorized to supervise completion of the work and
to submit the appropriate grade change request.

Any grade of I existing after the stated deadline shall be automatically
changed to E or U according to whether or not the student is enrolled
for A–E or S/U grading. Except for extenuating circumstances approved by
the Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education, these
converted grades may not be later changed.

(NOTE: Students receiving financial assistance through state awards
should refer to Academic Criteria for State Awards in the expenses and
financial aid section of this bulletin before requesting grades of I.)

*Important:* Incompletes will not be given to students who have not
fulfilled their classwork obligations, and who, at the end of the
semester, are looking to avoid failing the course. This is asking for
special treatment.

**Academic Integrity: It is every student’s responsibility to become familiar with the standards of academic integrity at the University. Claims of ignorance, of unintentional error, or of academic or personal pressures are not sufficient reasons for violations of academic integrity. See <http://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/regulations.html>**

Coursework and examinations are considered individual exercises. Copying
the work of others is a violation of university rules on academic
integrity.  Individual coursework is also key to your being prepared and
performing well on tests and exams. Forming study groups and discussing
assignments and techniques in general terms is encouraged, but the final
work must be your own work. **For example, two or more people may not
create an assignment together and submit it for credit. Credit will not
be given for identical final project reports with different color
palettes used on graphs submitted by two or more people.** If you have
specific questions about this or any other policy, please ask.

The following is a list of the types of behaviors that are defined as
examples of academic dishonesty and are therefore unacceptable. Attempts
to commit such acts also fall under the term academic dishonesty and are
subject to penalty. No set of guidelines can, of course, define all
possible types or degrees of academic dishonesty; thus, the following
descriptions should be understood as examples of infractions rather than
an exhaustive list.

- Plagiarism

- Allowing other students to see or copy your assignments or exams

- Examining or copying another student’s assignments or exams

- Lying to the professor about issues of academic integrity

- Submitting the same work for multiple assignments/classes without
  prior consent from the instructor(s)

- Getting answers or help from people, or other sources (*e.g.* research
  papers, web sites) without acknowledging them.

- Forgery

- Sabotage

- Unauthorized Collaboration (just check first!)

- Falsification

- Bribery

- Theft, Damage, or Misuse of Library or Computer Resources

*Any* incident of academic dishonesty in this course, no matter how
"minor" will result in

- No credit for the affected assignment.

- A written report will be sent to the appropriate University
  authorities (*e.g.* the Dean of Undergraduate Studies)

- One of -

  - A final mark reduction by *at* *least* one-half letter grade (*e.g.*
    B → B-, C- → D+),

  - A Failing mark (E) in the course, and referral of the matter to the
    University Judicial System for disposition.

**Time Management: For every credit hour that a course meets, students should expect to work 3 additional hours outside of class every week (3 x 3= 9). For a three-credit course, you should expect to work 9 hours outside of class every week. Manage your time effectively to complete readings, assignments, and projects.**

**Instructor Availability**: The instructor will be available for
student consultation during office hours, by appointment, and online in
Brightspace. Students are expected to check Brightspace messages
(internal) at least once every day to see whether the instructor is
trying to reach them. Students should not assume that instructor is
online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to answer your questions
immediately (even though the instructor will try to do so as much as
possible).

**Courtesy** In class (online) discussions the instructor and students
are expected to demonstrate professional behavior. This means
cooperating and interacting in a courteous, supportive, and tactful
manner based on mutual respect for each other's ideas.

**Students and professor should be professional at all time. Faculty
should be addressed as Prof. XXX or Dr. XXX. Emails should be addressed
“Dear…” and end with a “Thank you.” *Disrespect in any form in any CEHC
class will not be tolerated.***

**Respect for Diversity:** It is my intent that students from all
diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course, that
students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that
the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource,
strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and
activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality,
disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture.
Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways
to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for
other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class
meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that
we can make arrangements for you.[^3]
