## Course Description:

Introduction to information and technology in the 21st Century. Different resources, including the Internet, libraries, news sources and other sources of information, hardware, and Web 2.0 technologies will be explored. The primary emphasis of the class is on discovering reliable information sources for any and all subjects so that a student's future research and other pursuits are supported by the methods developed in this course. Each student is called upon to fortify their own individual communication and reasoning skills and will demonstrate the use of those skills through course assignments, class presentations and group activities. Only one version of T INF 100 or C INF 100 may be taken for credit. Honors College students only.

   - **Measure:** Students will differentiate between types of AI/ML systems and provide specific examples.  
   - **Corresponding Assignment:** A2 - Types of Machine Learning and their Applications

4. **Recognize** the strengths and limitations of AI/ML systems. **(1.3 I)**  
   - **Measure:** Students will analyze and discuss the pros and cons of different AI/ML systems.  
   - **Corresponding Assignment:** A3 - Evaluating Deep Learning Models

5. **Understand** the importance of data in AI/ML, including data gathering, cleaning, and visualization. **(C1.2 I)**  
   - **Measure:** Students will demonstrate data collection, cleaning, and visualization techniques.  
   - **Corresponding Assignment:** Lab 2 - Data Collection and Initial Exploration (Hands On Code Review)

6. **Identify and understand** legal issues related to computing. **(4.1 B)**  
   - **Measure:** Students will identify potential biases and ethical concerns in AI/ML systems and suggest mitigation strategies.  
   - **Corresponding Assignment:** In-Class Teamwork - AI Ethics and Bias Detectives

7. **Reflect** on the societal impact of AI/ML technologies. **(4.4 A)**  
   - **Measure:** Students will write or present reflections on how AI/ML affects society.  
   - **Corresponding Assignment:** In-Class Activity - DL Ethical Dilemmas and Case Study Analysis

8. **Communicate** technical information effectively through writing and presentations. **(3.2 I)**  
   - **Measure:** Students will produce well written reports and deliver oral presentations on AI/ML topics.  
   - **Corresponding Assignment:** Showcase Participation and Presentation

9. **Collaborate** effectively in team settings. **(5.1 B)**  
   - **Measure:** Teamwork and collaboration will be assessed through peer evaluations, instructor observations during group activities, and a reflective self-assessment detailing individual contributions and group dynamics.  
   - **Corresponding Assignment:** Lab 5 - Advanced Applications and Project

By achieving these outcomes, students will gain foundational knowledge of the challenges and potential of AI/ML systems to prepare for further study or careers in the field.

## Prerequisites:

*None.*

## Required Readings:

The required text for this course is:

<img src="media/image1.jpeg" style="width:1.5in;height:2.35in" alt="Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-technical Introduction by Taulli, Tom" />

- ***Taulli, Tom, Artificial Intelligence Basics: A Non-technical Introduction.*** 2019. Apress. ISBN-13: 978-1-4842-5028-0.

In addition to the required text, there will be readings that will be available to the students online or via Brightspace. When these readings are assigned, the class will be told where they can be found. These will cover the various topics in the course and will be drawn from the literature in several fields (e.g. computer science, electrical and computer engineering, psychology, informatics, law) to help inform us about the multiple perspectives necessary to understand Artificial Intelligence. This will also provide the underlying information to help us learn to critically evaluate and navigate our own digital lives securely in this rapidly changing world.

The above formula is the definitive grading scheme. Any “Total,” “Weighted Total,” etc. given by Brightspace does not reflect the actual grading scheme and should be ignored.

Grades are assigned based upon the percentage of points achieved by the student in the course, as weighted per the above table. The overall course **will not** be curved, although the professor retains the right curve individual assignments if the grade distribution is extreme enough to unfairly weight the overall course against the students.

This course is A-E graded and the grades are determined based on graded assignments. Your final grade will be based on a scale of 100 points:

| **A**  | **A-** | **B+** | **B** | **B-** | **C+** | **C** | **C-** | **D+** | **D** | **D-** | **E** |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
